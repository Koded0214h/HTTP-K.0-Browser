# HTTP/K.0 Browser — Low-Latency Game-Focused Browser

![Browser Logo](./assets/logo.png)

## 🚀 Overview

**HTTP/K.0 Browser** is a next-generation, custom web browser designed for **low-latency gaming, streaming, and concurrency**.  
It implements its own transport protocol, **HTTP/K.0**, inspired by QUIC, combining **UDP, WebSockets, TLS, and optional header compression**. The goal is to deliver **ultra-fast, reliable browsing and real-time web interactions**, optimized for performance-sensitive applications like cloud gaming and live multiplayer experiences.

Written in **Rust** for safety, concurrency, and high performance, HTTP/K.0 Browser is more than just a browser — it’s a foundation for a **new ecosystem** of low-latency web apps.

## 🌐 Key Features

- **Custom Transport (HTTP/K.0)**  
  - UDP-based, QUIC-inspired protocol.  
  - Multiplexed streams with partial reliability.  
  - Low-latency packet delivery optimized for real-time apps.  

- **Security**  
  - TLS1.3 integration for encryption and forward secrecy.  
  - Safe Rust memory model to prevent common vulnerabilities.  

- **Game-Optimized Streaming**  
  - Unordered and unreliable streams for frequent game state updates.  
  - Frame prioritization to minimize latency for critical messages.  
  - Optional FEC (Forward Error Correction) for smooth audio/video streaming.  

- **Cross-Platform Ecosystem Ready**  
  - Designed to run on desktop, mobile, and cloud gaming platforms.  
  - Pluggable network, rendering, and UI layers for future extensions.  

- **Developer-Friendly API**  
  - `k0://` URL scheme for native HTTP/K.0 requests.  
  - Async fetch API for real-time, low-latency data streaming.

## 📦 Architecture Overview

### 1. Transport Layer
- UDP + TLS encrypted packets.  
- Multiplexed streams with optional reliability flags.  
- Header compression for efficiency (HPACK/QPACK or custom).

### 2. Protocol Layer (HTTP/K.0)
- Packet framing:
  - **Packet header**: Connection ID, Packet Number, Flags.  
  - **Frames**: STREAM, ACK, CONTROL, FEC, PATH_CHALLENGE.  
- Partial reliability for real-time streaming.  
- Unordered stream support for low-latency updates.

### 3. Browser Engine (Minimal)
- HTML parser → DOM tree.  
- CSS parser → CSSOM tree.  
- Render tree → console or GPU rendering (future).  
- Async fetching over HTTP/K.0 protocol.

### 4. UI Layer
- Minimal CLI/browser shell initially.  
- Future plans: graphical UI with tabs, address bar, and integrated developer tools.

## 🛠️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Protocol & Transport
- Design packet formats, handshake, and stream model.  
- Implement UDP client/server with Rust async (Tokio).  
- Add TLS encryption and basic reliability.

### Phase 2: Browser Skeleton
- Minimal CLI browser capable of fetching HTML over HTTP/K.0.  
- HTML parser and basic DOM tree construction.

### Phase 3: Rendering & Interactivity
- Render text-only content → later integrate GPU/graphical rendering.  
- Add CSS parsing for simple styling.  
- Add JS engine (optional, later).

### Phase 4: Optimization & Features
- Stream prioritization and partial reliability.  
- FEC for smooth streaming.  
- Multipath & adaptive congestion control for gaming.  
- Build cross-platform support (desktop & mobile).

## ⚡ Example Packet/Frame Structure

```text
Packet Header (UDP):
[8B ConnectionID] [varint PacketNum] [1B Flags] [Payload...]

Frames in Payload:
0x00 STREAM    {stream_id, offset, flags, data}
0x01 ACK       {ack ranges}
0x02 CONTROL   {control messages}
0x03 FEC       {parity data}
0x04 PATH_CHALLENGE {NAT/path verification}
```
---
## Stream Flags:
- Bit 0: Ordered (1) / Unordered (0)
- Bit 1: Reliable (1) / Partial (0)
